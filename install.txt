Problem statement 
Implement an IP based rate limiting feature for an api endpoint . The rate limiting implementation should poses the following features 
- Capable of identifying whether an incoming IP is malicious or not (This can be acheived by using the virus total api provided in the document below)
- Keep track of the number of occurance of the IP addresses if they are not malicious
- Have a threshold value set up for ip address that are not malicious . If the threshold is breached then block the next occurance of the IP .
- If an Ip is malicious then block it for future occurances and skip threshold detection .


## Setting Up fastapi 
python3 -m venv venv 
cd venv/bin/ && source activate && cd .././
pip3 install fastapi
pip3 install "uvicorn[standard]"

## run to check the server 
uvicorn template:app --reload    


## virus total api key

api-key : key

### Curl command for Virus Total 
curl --request GET \         
  --url https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/ip_addresses/{ip} \
  --header 'x-apikey: key'
